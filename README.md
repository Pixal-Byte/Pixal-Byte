# 👋 Hi, I'm Pixal-Byte!

#### Student • Aspiring Programmer & Photographer

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a student who loves to explore the worlds of programming and photography. Right now I'm probably experimenting with code or capturing moments in raw light and color, either way I'm always learning something new.
